ITNRO TO HTML:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. (text that can link to other texts)
- made up of tags

homepage always should be name index.html (beause of server reasons)

Workspace Folder: (root directory)
    index.html - homepage 
        auto generate DOCTYPE !+tab 
        <!DOCTYPE html> .... </html>

        <head> - is where all the extra information goes 
        <title></title> - the tab title, and the google search information
        <meta></meta> - charset="utf-8" - standar for most language that saves
            save all the character set that we are going to use on the screen.
        

        <body></body> - information in the body tag will show up on the webpage.
        <br> - creates new line (br = break)
        <p></p> paragraph tag - makes new line breaks for us. 
        <em></em> = <i> , but we NEVER use <i> tag! 
        <strong></strong> = <b> the bold tag, but we NEVER use it! 

    css: - stylesheet (the look of ur webpage)
        We use the style="" <- this is called a inline style, avoid USING THIS! 
        We use hexidecimal for the color of the font because we can change the hue of the color.
        font-family changes the text style.
        Stylesheets have a cascading effect. Meaning it affects whatever is in the tag!
        External stylesheet are much easier to make changes. rather then using inline style's

        Example: (btwn stylesheet and inline style)
        compare index.html and page2.html 
        index.html uses the stylesheet and page2.html uses the inline style 
        *** never mix inline and stylesheet ***
        *** always use stylesheets ! ***

         



File organization:
       *** very important when creating a web design.***
       *** always name thing lowercase for folder names ***
       *** try to be very specific when naming your files ***
       *** avoid spaces in all files! ***
        img folder. (sub directory) images
        css folder (sub directory) stylesheet
        js folder (sub directory) javascript
